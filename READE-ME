Libft
📖 About
Libft is a custom C library that reimplements many standard library functions and introduces additional utility functions. It’s designed as a foundational project at 42 School to deepen understanding of C and provide a reusable library for future projects.

💡 Purpose
Learn how standard C library functions work.
Build a reusable library for future coding projects.
Practice memory management, algorithms, and pointers

🚀 Usage
1. Build the Library
Run the following command in the project directory:

make
This generates libft.a, the compiled library.

Compile your program with Libft:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror your_file.c -L. -lft -o your_program

📂 Features
Reimplementations of functions like strlen, strcpy, atoi, etc.
Utility functions such as ft_split, ft_strjoin, and more.
Optional linked list management functions if needed.

📝 Note
This project follows the 42 School Norm.
